#Review of the "standards" section in ps(1).

= Introduction =

The ps man page "standards" man page says:
{{{
       This ps conforms to:

       1   Version 2 of the Single Unix Specification
       2   The Open Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 6
       3   IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition
       4   X/Open System Interfaces Extension [UP XSI]
       5   ISO/IEC 9945:2003
}}}

At first glance, I thought conforming to five different standards is why it is a mess. Later I reviewed these standards.

In fact, these five standards are the *same* thing. And they are the same thing with POSIX:2004. One of the official texts of this standards is located [
