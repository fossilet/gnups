#New Command Options Design

=Principles=

  * There *must* be no BSD options. All options must either start with `-`(Unix options) or `--`(GNU long options).
  * It *must* be POSIX.1 2008 compliant. http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ps.html 
  * It *can* be incompatible with `ps`.
  * There *should* be only one unix option for each feature.
  * There *should* be more GNU options.
