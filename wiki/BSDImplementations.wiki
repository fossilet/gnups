#WTF is BSD options?

= Introduction =

I hate the BSD options.

= Details =

The man page of ps says:

2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.

I have been using a FreeBSD machine for years. But I never think of BSD options as options without a dash. Maybe the author refers to very old BSDs. I checked the ps in NetBSD 5.0. It only accept options preceded by a dash, which in what ps calls "Unix options".

WTF?
