#WTF is BSD options?

= Introduction =

I hate the BSD options.

= Details =

The man page of ps says:

2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.

I have been using a FreeBSD machine for years. But I never think of BSD options as options without a dash. Maybe the author refers to very old BSDs. I checked the ps in NetBSD 5.0. It only accept options preceded by a dash, which in what ps calls "Unix options".

WTF?

= BSD options equivalent =

The BSD options can be safely removed support, and there are Unix and GNU equivalent options. Only single BSD options are listed. Combinations are not listed, since there is little meaning.

|| BSD option || Equivalent || Function || Note ||
|| `ps a` || `ps -o pid,tname,stat,bsdtime,command -N -t -` || List all processes with a terminal. ||  ||
|| `ps g` || `/bin/ps -o pid,tname,stat,bsdtime,command -u $EUID -N -t -` || List all processes with a terminal and owned by yourself || Won't work, why? ||
|| `ps T` || `ps -o pid,tname,stat,bsdtime,command` || Select all processes associated with this terminal. ||  ||
